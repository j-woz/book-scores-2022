\begin{abstract}
\noindent Here we present the results of the 2021-2022 Well-Read Gentlemen's Book Club Survey.
\end{abstract}

\noindent Over the summer of 2022 we conducted a survey\footnote{Google Form: LINK} to determine the best and most controversial books for the 2021-2022 club year.

The books read are listed in \TABLE{books}.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    \B{Date} & \B{Abbrev.} & \B{Title} & \B{Author} \\ \hline \hline
    Sep.  8 &  \B{C\&P} & Crime and Punishment & Fyodor Dostoyevski \\
    Oct. 11 & \B{Ender's} &  Ender's Game & Orson Scott Card \\
    Nov.  8 &  \B{Love-Ruins} & Love in the Ruins & Walker Percy \\
    Dec. 13 &  \B{Leopard} & The Leopard & Giuseppe di Lampedusa \\
    Jan. 10 & \B{Faces} & Til We Have Faces & C.S. Lewis \\
    Feb.  7 &  \B{Lear} & King Lear & William Shakespeare \\
    Mar. 14 &  \B{Iliad} & Iliad & Homer \\
    Apr. 11 & \B{Confessions} & Confessions & St. Augustine \\
    May   9 & \B{Violent} & The Violent Bear it Away & Flannery O'Connor \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Table of books. \label{table:books}}
\end{table}

The main question asked was ``How ?.''  The question was on a scale of 1-5, with 5 as best.  Averages and standard deviations are shown in \PLOT{scores}.  As shown in the plot, Faces scored the highest.

Standard deviations for the same question are shown in \PLOT{stddevs}.  As shown in the plot, Ender's was the most controversial book.

In the future, we plan to split the question into three: A) a score based on personal preferences, B) a score based on appropriateness, and C) a score based on discussion quality.  We also plan to refine the score from a 5-point scale to a 10-point scale for better resolution.
